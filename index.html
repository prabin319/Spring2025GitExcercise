    <p> Hi, I am Prabin Khadka, a passionate and determined individual from the beautiful Himalayan nation of Nepal. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in South Korea, a journey that has been both exciting and challenging. As an international student, I face the common struggles of adapting to a new culture, overcoming language barriers, and maintaining a delicate balance between work and academics. Despite these hurdles, I remain resilient and focused on my goals.
        With a growing interest in the field of Information Technology, I am determined to carve out a career as a web designer. Though I am relatively new to the IT world, my curiosity and eagerness to learn are driving me to explore the creative and technical aspects of web design. I envision a future where I can combine my technical skills with my creative vision to build user-friendly and visually appealing websites.
        My journey is a testament to my perseverance and adaptability. As I navigate the challenges of studying abroad, I continue to grow both personally and professionally, steadily working toward my dream of becoming a successful web designer.
